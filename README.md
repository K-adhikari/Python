This repository contains codes I wrote in python as a part of the assignment when I was taking 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course in Coursera. For some of the functions, starter codes were provided by the instructors.

DNA_processing_basics.py contains functions to:
- Get length of a DNA sequence
- Count the appearance of a specific nucleotide in a given sequence
- Check if the given sequence is a valid DNA sequence
- Insert a second DNA sequence into the first one at a defined index position
- Get complement of a nucleotide
- Get complementary seqeunce of a given sequence
- Get reverse complement of a given sequence
- Get GC content of a given sequence


Time_zones.py contains functions to:
- Get time difference in seconds
- Convert time given in hours, minutes, and seconds to hours
- Convert time given in seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds
- Convert time to UTC
- Convert time from UTC


Word_search.py contains codes to implement a word search game. The script contains functions to:
- Check whether a guessed word is valid
- Create a string from the lost of single character strings representing a row
- Create a string from the lost of single character strings representing a column
- Check whether a word occurs in any of the rows
- Check whether a word occurs in any of the columns
- Check whether a word occurs in any of the rows or columns
- Calculate the score for a correctly guessed word
- Update score to a player's score
- Count the number of words from the list that appear on the board
- Create a words list made up of the words from a file
- Create a board made up of the rows of letters from a file


Final_exam.py contains functions to:
- Get the reverse of a string
- Check if given two words start with same letters
- Check if all integers in first list denote the lengths of strings in the second list
- Return a tuple where negative and non-negative numbers are in separate lists
- Add the letter counts from a word to the dictionary
