This repository contains codes I wrote in python as a part of the assignment when I was taking 'Learn to Program: The Fundamentals' course in Coursera.

DNA_manipulation_basics.py contains functions to:
- Get length of a DNA sequence
- Count the appearance of a specific nucleotide in a given sequence
- Check if the given sequence is a valid DNA sequence
- Insert a second DNA sequence into the first one at a defined index position
- Get complement of a nucleotide
- Get complementary seqeunce of a given sequence
- Get reverse complement of a given sequence
